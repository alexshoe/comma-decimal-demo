# Comma Decimal Demo

This Dash app was created for Plotly.

## Running this application

1. Install the Python dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. Run the following command:

```python
python index.py
```

> Note:

> 1. This command was adapted from the Procfile, which is the list of commands that are used when the application is deployed. The only difference is that `gunicorn` was replaced with `python` for running the application locally with Dash's devtools and reloading features.
